# One-Time Password

The `<OTP>` component provides a way to manage one-time-password entry using the common pattern where each character entry for the one-time-password is its own field, while also managing accessibility requirements of a multi-field input. 

For more information on OTP patterns, see [web.dev's SMS OTP Form](https://web.dev/sms-otp-form/)[^sms]

Before reaching for this component, consider if the [`WebOTP` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebOTP_API) and/or the [native `<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) with [`autocomplete="one-time-code"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete#browser_compatibility) is sufficient for your use case.

## Anatomy

```js 
import { OTP } from 'ember-primitives';
```

or for non-tree-shaking environments:
```js 
import { OTP } from 'ember-primitives/components/one-time-password';
```


```gjs 
import { OTP } from 'ember-primitives';

<template>
  <OTP as |x|>
    text can go here, or in between the below components

    <x.Input />
    <x.Submit> submit text </x.Submit>
    <x.Reset> reset text </x.Reset>

    text can go here as well
  </OTP>
</template>
```

Additionally, the customization from `<OTPInput>` is available as well

```gjs 
import { OTP } from 'ember-primitives';

<template>
  <OTP as |x|>
    <x.Input as |Fields|>
        <Fields />
    </x.Input>

    <x.Submit> submit text </x.Submit>
  </OTP>
</template>
```


## Accessibility

This component complies with all `<form>` and `<input>` accessibility guidelines.
It is rendered within a fieldset to convey that all of the character inputs are related.
